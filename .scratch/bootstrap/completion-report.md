# Greek Essence Bootstrap Completion Report

**Status:** Complete — all 28 bootstrap tasks and all 8 phases `Done`
**Prepared:** 2026-07-23
**Completed:** 2026-07-23
**Resolved implementation depth:** Tier 2 — Prototype
**Root integrator:** `20260723_132446_29d092`
**Readiness verdict:** All recorded local bootstrap gates are green; independent B07-03 task review and final Phase 07 review approved the report and exit gate. This historical report does not approve production promotion. Its original runtime and compatibility observations below are non-normative records; the current development contract is maintained by `package.json` and current repository guidance.

## Scope delivered

The bootstrap established the private bilingual prototype foundation: a static-first Next.js App Router application with English/Greek routes, local fixture content, strict TypeScript, approved repository-local agent skills, Playwright and accessibility coverage, and integrated quality gates. Production capabilities remain deferred according to the [production-readiness gap register](../../docs/03_technical_design/22_production_readiness_gap_register.md).

## Files added and modified

B07-03 task-owned tracked records:

- `.agents/README.md` — reconciled the canonical project-local Playwright CLI provenance from 0.1.14 to 0.1.17, while recording the separately installed global CLI at 0.1.14.
- `.scratch/bootstrap/completion-report.md` — this report.
- `.scratch/bootstrap/README.md` — active-task and next-task entry-point state.
- `.scratch/bootstrap/phases/07-final-verification/status.md` — B07-03 state.
- `.scratch/bootstrap/phases/07-final-verification/tasks/03-completion-report/task.md` — session, start time, and task state.
- `.scratch/bootstrap/phases/07-final-verification/tasks/03-completion-report/implementation-report.md` and `evidence.md` — implementation and verification records.

No application source, package manifest, lockfile, generated runtime artifact, remote, history, deployment, credential, or reviewer-owned file was changed by B07-03. Ignored quality artifacts remain under `.artifacts/bootstrap/`; the final Unlighthouse artifact is [ci-result.json](../../.artifacts/bootstrap/unlighthouse/ci-result.json).

## Agent skills and provenance

The canonical inventory is [`../../.agents/README.md`](../../.agents/README.md). Exact revisions, installation/generation commands, normalization, exclusions, and licenses are:

- `bootstrap-next`: project-owned commit `158093188ccf44ffa35ce2a2473b4137cb1159ac`; authored locally; project-owned content, no third-party license.
- `ralph-loop-manager`: project-owned current revision `05884bb`; authored locally; project-owned content, no third-party license. Its approved profile-level email-notification exception is not vendored.
- `modern-web-guidance`: upstream `GoogleChrome/modern-web-guidance`, commit `79aae1e0bed948e48fd78b58538c5ee1e6463da9`, release `v0.0.177`; wrapper `modern-web-guidance@0.0.177`, registry gitHead `d07f33a3fb6b0056d3d7140e2952c89b3a72aa89`; install entry `npx modern-web-guidance@latest install`; Apache-2.0. The retained local selection is `SKILL.md`, `LICENSE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` after verified normalization.
- `vercel-react-best-practices`: upstream `vercel-labs/agent-skills`, `skills/react-best-practices/`, commit `4559f18a20c1691c744b4395194290db6a0df5e9`; install entry `npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices`; MIT declared in upstream skill front matter; local copy is the 76-file normalized layout.
- `playwright-cli`: npm `@playwright/cli@0.1.17`, repository `https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli`, integrity `sha512-VBw6y3p8eqOqmjKg07IkWSPGKJkpIhMRNDFI6DOYsDD6fAfcI1XYEWMLWyhSZQ0B/Oc2KN49eq4XqE64PUPHBg==`; generation command `pnpm exec playwright-cli install --skills=agents`; Apache-2.0; 11 canonical Markdown files after normalization.
- `greek-essence-quality-review`: project-owned commit `8c4661a249799474788388c8c198b12a8cd6111b`; authored locally; project-owned content, no third-party license; one `SKILL.md` and five focused references.

Installer output was normalized only where recorded: CRLF-to-LF for copied upstream skill files. Unselected generated guide catalogs, agent-specific duplicate copies, optional disciplines, executables, and workspace state were omitted or removed as documented in the inventory and task evidence; no alternative browser tool was installed.

## Exact installation and generation commands

- `npx modern-web-guidance@latest install` — documented canonical wrapper entry; inspected equivalent `npx -y skills add GoogleChrome/modern-web-guidance --skill modern-web-guidance --yes --copy` passed in the isolated B01-02 verification.
- `npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices` — canonical entry recorded; the pinned B01-04 source was normalized-copied from the isolated checkout.
- `playwright-cli install --skills` — original global generation path recorded by B01-05; the current canonical project-local path `pnpm exec playwright-cli install --skills=agents` passed during B06-02.
- Project-owned skills were authored in-repository; no installer command applies.

## Historical compatibility record (non-normative)

- Codex: B01-07 explicitly loaded all five approved baseline skills with `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check ...`; each command exited `0`. The exact responses are recorded under `.artifacts/bootstrap/B01-07/`. Current `codex --version` exited `0` with `codex-cli 0.145.0`.
- A second-agent probe was not available during bootstrap: `command -v kimi` exited `1` and no executable was found. No usage test ran. This is retained as factual historical evidence only; it is not a current requirement, blocker, compatibility claim, or acceptance gate, and no substitute tool was introduced.

## Playwright CLI and quality results

B06-02 used the project-local CLI `0.1.17` on `/en`, `/el`, `/en/quality-lab`, and `/el/quality-lab` at `390x844` and `1440x1024`: exit `0`, zero console errors/warnings, only HTTP 200/304 responses, zero viewport overflow, and successful language, keyboard-focus, and localized primitive interactions. Detailed route/viewport evidence is in [B06-02 evidence](phases/06-quality-review/tasks/02-playwright-cli-inspection/evidence.md).

B07-01 clean-room evidence records a fresh copy without `node_modules` or `.next`, frozen install exit `0`, unchanged lock identity, and `pnpm check:all` exit `0`; see [B07-01 evidence](phases/07-final-verification/tasks/01-clean-room-verification/evidence.md). B07-02 was approved after its aggregate gate and review reconciliation; see [B07-02 evidence](phases/07-final-verification/tasks/02-aggregate-quality-gate/evidence.md) and [B07-02 re-review](phases/07-final-verification/tasks/02-aggregate-quality-gate/reviews/02-review.md).

## Baseline and quality-command results

The B07-02 final records report exit `0` for `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint` (0 errors, 2 existing warnings), `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:unit` (3/3), `pnpm build`, `pnpm test:e2e` (27/27), `pnpm test:a11y` (12/12, zero axe violations), `pnpm quality:unlighthouse` (four routes and locked budgets), and `pnpm check:all`. The B07-03 final aggregate verification is recorded in [B07-03 evidence](phases/07-final-verification/tasks/03-completion-report/evidence.md).

The final Unlighthouse artifact covers `/el`, `/el/quality-lab`, `/en`, and `/en/quality-lab`; performance is `0.93`, `0.92`, `0.93`, and `0.93`, respectively, with accessibility, best-practices, and SEO `1.00` for every route.

## Exact task and phase counts

There are exactly `28` unique tasks. Current counts are `28/28 Done` overall:

- Phases 00–06: `25/25 Done` (`2/2`, `7/7`, `3/3`, `4/4`, `3/3`, `3/3`, `3/3`).
- Phase 07: `3/3 Done`; B07-03 received independent task-review approval.
- Phase 07 is `Done`; independent Phase 07 review approved the exit gate.

## Deviations, unresolved issues, and excluded future work

- Historical bootstrap compatibility evidence is retained above for auditability and is not a current project blocker.
- The global Playwright CLI remains `0.1.14`, while the project-local canonical CLI is `0.1.17`; all project verification uses the pinned local CLI.
- The first standalone Unlighthouse attempt and the first B07-01 browser-download attempt failed transiently and are retained as superseded evidence; successful retries are not concealed.
- No deviation from the Tier 2 task contract is claimed. Independent B07-03 task review and Phase 07 review approved the records and final exit gate. No push, deploy, remote/history change, or production promotion was performed.
- Production launch remains explicitly deferred until the gaps in the [production-readiness gap register](../../docs/03_technical_design/22_production_readiness_gap_register.md) are resolved, including commercial hosting, durable lead records, delivery recovery, retention/DSR, ownership, analytics, observability, spam resilience, legal pages, trust assets, final content/media, browser support, and production email operations.

Bootstrap work is complete. Product implementation may begin from this documented baseline only when separately authorized, subject to the explicit production-readiness gaps.
