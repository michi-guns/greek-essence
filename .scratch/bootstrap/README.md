# Greek Essence Bootstrap Workspace

This tracked workspace coordinates repository bootstrap only. It does not authorize implementation of Greek Essence product pages, content, forms, email delivery, authentication, analytics, or deployment.

## Current status

| Phase | State | Tasks done |
|---|---|---:|
| 00 — Planning and baseline | Done | 2/2 |
| 01 — Agent tooling | Done | 7/7 |
| 02 — Application scaffold | Done | 3/3 |
| 03 — Code hygiene | Done | 4/4 |
| 04 — Bilingual fixtures | Done | 3/3 |
| 05 — Automated tests | Done | 3/3 |
| 06 — Quality review | Done | 3/3 |
| 07 — Final verification | Done | 3/3 |

**Current task:** None — bootstrap campaign complete.
**Next unblocked task:** None — all 28 bootstrap tasks and all 8 phases are `Done`.

B07-01 is `Done` after approved clean-room verification under the operator-clarified Tier 2 contract: a fresh copy without project dependencies/build output installed the unchanged frozen lockfile and passed `pnpm check:all`; normal pnpm content-addressed cache reuse was allowed. B07-02 is `Done` after all aggregate gates passed and independent review approved the reconciled evidence. B07-03 is `Done` after its evidence-backed completion report received independent task-review approval. Independent Phase 07 review approved the final exit gate; the bootstrap campaign is complete.

Historical compatibility probes remain factual non-normative records and are not current requirements or blockers. The former B01-03 source blocker is resolved by BD-015.

## Operating rules

The normative procedure and role boundaries are in [`protocol.md`](protocol.md). In summary:

- The root integrator selects dependency-ready work, delegates it, reconciles repository-wide state, updates tracking, creates one dedicated Task-ID commit after each successful task closure, and controls phase commits. It does not implement delegated tasks or review its own work.
- A fresh implementer owns exactly one task, its evidence, report, and accepted review fixes. It does not commit, broaden scope, modify review files, or mark its work `Done`.
- A different fresh task reviewer independently checks the diff and evidence and re-runs proportionate verification. It does not edit implementation or approve unresolved blocking/high findings.
- A fresh phase reviewer validates integration and the phase exit gate after task reviews pass. It does not substitute phase review for missing task review.
- The human operator handles destructive/overwrite approvals, credentials, scope changes, and material exceptions—not routine coordination.
- Generated evidence belongs in ignored `.artifacts/bootstrap/`; tracked `evidence.md` files record commands and results.

Every participating agent must read the protocol first.

Ralph-loop completion is controlled only by `.scratch/ralph-loop/completion-signal.json` containing exactly `{ "isEverythingDone": true }`; Sol owns the project-state judgment and must set it only after all managed work and final quality gates succeed.

Allowed states: `Pending`, `Ready`, `In progress`, `In review`, `Blocked`, `Done`, `Deferred`.
