## 5. Root `AGENTS.md`

### 5.1 Purpose

`AGENTS.md` provides the compact repository-wide instruction layer that Codex CLI can read before ordinary work.

It should remain concise. It must point to authoritative documents and approved skills rather than restating their contents.

### 5.2 Required contents

Include:

- project-document authority and precedence;
- the supported package manager and version policy;
- required baseline and quality commands from the repository;
- strict TypeScript requirement;
- static-first architecture and narrow dynamic boundary;
- Server Component and Client Component expectations;
- prohibition on adding a database, CMS, CRM, analytics provider, booking system, or other deferred production capability without approval;
- English and Greek locale requirement;
- requirement to follow the UX, accessibility, responsive, content, and form behavior defined by `02_PROTOTYPE_SPECIFICATION.md`;
- requirement to follow the technical architecture and quality gates defined by `03_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`;
- instruction to use Playwright CLI for interactive browser inspection;
- instruction not to install or use Playwright MCP, Browser Use, or `agent-browser`;
- list of approved repository-local skills and when to apply them;
- requirement to prefer simple, maintainable, battle-tested solutions when several valid implementations exist;
- concise definition of done.
