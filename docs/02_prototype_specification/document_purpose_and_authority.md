## 0. Document Purpose and Authority

This document translates the Greek Essence Product Requirements Document (PRD) into an implementation-neutral specification for information architecture, responsive page composition, reusable interface patterns, interaction behavior, visual direction, prototyping, and usability testing.

It is intended for UX and UI designers, content designers, prototype builders, usability researchers, developers receiving the design, product stakeholders, and future AI contributors.

### 0.1 Authority and precedence

The project documentation hierarchy is:

1. `00_PROJECT_PROTOCOL.md` — process and documentation governance.
2. `01_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` — product and business truth.
3. This document — UX, UI, interaction, and prototype decisions.
4. `03_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` — implementation decisions.
5. `04_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — visual-system decisions.

If this document conflicts with the PRD, the PRD governs. The original UX Strategy and Website Requirements Brief supplies supplementary visual and interaction evidence only. Unknown business facts are not resolved here.

### 0.2 What this document decides

This document governs:

- page and section hierarchy;
- navigation and responsive behavior;
- reusable UI patterns, variants, and states;
- interaction and form behavior;
- content placement and editorial hierarchy;
- prototype flows and coverage;
- UX-level accessibility;
- visual-content and motion direction;
- usability-testing scenarios;
- prototype acceptance criteria.

It does not govern frameworks, libraries, APIs, data models, hosting, databases, analytics vendors, form services, or code architecture.

### 0.3 Requirement language

- **Must:** required for prototype acceptance unless explicitly deferred.
- **Should:** expected unless a documented design constraint justifies an alternative.
- **May:** optional or dependent on content, operations, or validation.
- **Provisional:** usable in the prototype but awaiting owner, legal, content, or operational approval.

### 0.4 Prototype fidelity

The prototype must support three levels of work:

- **Structural:** sitemap, hierarchy, routes, component placement, and responsive reflow.
- **Behavioral:** navigation, menus, language switching, accordions, form progression, validation, error recovery, and confirmation.
- **Presentational:** representative typography, color, imagery, spacing, states, and motion sufficient to test the intended quiet-premium experience.

Production copy and imagery may remain provisional during prototyping, but placeholders must be realistic, clearly identified internally, and must not introduce unapproved claims.
