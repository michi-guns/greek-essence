# Publish the bootstrap completion report

## What

Finalize the report, dashboard, entry-point links, versions, evidence, and deviations.

## Why

The implementation phase needs an exact and honest starting state.

## How

- Report files, versions, upstream revisions, commands, normalization, licenses, Codex validation, Playwright CLI evidence, and every quality result.
- Restate excluded future work and update exact task counts.
- Do not introduce an additional agent compatibility requirement.

## Required reading

- `docs/05_agent_skills/17_required_completion_report.md`
- `docs/03_technical_design/21_implementation_phases.md`
- `docs/03_technical_design/22_production_readiness_gap_register.md`

## Bootstrap verification contract

Apply verification row B07-03 and all relevant locked defaults from [the Bootstrap Verification Matrix](../../../../verification-matrix.md). Record exact commands, exit codes, and artifact paths in evidence.md.

## Acceptance

The completion report is link-valid, evidence-backed, includes every required field and exact count, and does not introduce a second-agent acceptance gate.
